INTRODUCTION

The OCR Data Collection Tool is a straightforward and user-friendly platform designed
to simplify the process of gathering high-quality annotated data that is essential for training
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models. The tool acts as a bridge between data
contributors and administrators, ensuring that both parties can work together efficiently
to build effective OCR systems. Its main features include the ability for users to upload
images containing text in various formats and languages. This is important because OCR
models need data in different types and languages to function accurately across diverse use
cases.

Once the images are uploaded, users can manually type the text seen in the image. This
feature enables users to directly input the content they see, which helps ensure that the data
is accurately labeled. Accurate labeling is crucial as it guarantees that the OCR models
will be trained with correct data, which directly improves their ability to recognize and
interpret text from different images. After the annotations are made, the tool has a strict
review process where administrators carefully examine the images and their corresponding
typed text to ensure everything is accurate, complete, and meets the required standards.
This strict review process helps maintain the quality and integrity of the data, ensuring that
only reliable data is used for training purposes.

Once the images and their corresponding text pass the review process, they are securely
stored in a database, creating an organized and comprehensive dataset ready for training
OCR models. By providing a clear and structured approach to data collection and valida
tion, the tool guarantees that high-quality data is used to train OCR systems, improving
their accuracy and efficiency. This platform enables users to actively participate in the de-
velopment of cutting-edge OCR technology, while administrators ensure that every piece
of data is thoroughly checked and validated to uphold the highest standards.
